BTCfinder 0.9 - README
BTCfinder 0.9 is a powerful tool designed to find private keys for Bitcoin wallets using the Pollard Rho algorithm. It leverages GPU acceleration to perform high-speed calculations, making it one of the most efficient solutions for this purpose.

Features
Pollard Rho Algorithm: Utilizes the Pollard Rho algorithm for finding private keys.
GPU Acceleration: Optimized to run on CUDA-compatible GPUs for maximum performance.
Multi-processing: Uses multi-processing to distribute the workload across multiple CPU cores.
Progress Persistence: Saves progress periodically to resume in case of interruptions.
Logging: Comprehensive logging to track the progress and identify issues.
